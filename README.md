# Deceptive-Storytelling
Deceptive Storytelling using AI planning and Chat GPT

The idea of this project is employing recent AI Planning techniques for storytelling [1] and deception [2] and combine them with Large Language Models, e.g., ChatGPT [3].
So the aim of the project would be to develop an AI system that is able to mislead and deceive via storytelling. This AI system should be able to reason about its knowledge and then autonomously adjust the story it tells depending on what its interlocutors might know and on how sensitive it considers the conversation topic to be.
